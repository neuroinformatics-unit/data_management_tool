# How to Choose a Terminal

**datashuttle**'s graphical interface can run in almost any terminalâ€”but
native Windows and macOS terminals may display with minor graphical errors.

If you are using Linux, the native terminal will work without issue.

## Choosing a terminal for Windows or macOS

:::{tab-item} Windows

For Windows, we recommend using
[Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&hl=en-gb&gl=GB),
Window's own high-powered terminal available for free from the
Microsoft Store.

**datashuttle** will run in Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`), Powershell (`ps.exe`)
or [Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/getting-started/index.html),
but may display with minor graphical errors.

:::{tab-item} macOS

On macOS, we recommend using next-generation terminal emulators such
as [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)
or [Warp](https://warp.dev/).
Both come with easy-to-use installers.

**datashuttle** will run on the native macOS terminal but may display
with minor graphical errors.
