# Roadmap

Here we present the roadmap for
[NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/)
and **datashuttle**. The roadmap is responsive to the requirements
of the community and we encourage people to get in
contact to outline their needs and priorities!

The aim of the first version of **NeuroBlueprint** (v0.2) and **datashuttle** (v0.4)
is to provide a lightweight, standardised framework enabling automatic discovery
of raw data and derivatives for different data types (e.g., behavior, electrophysiology).

The next aim will be to support automated multimodal analysis, which will
require metadata (e.g. sync pulses information) standardisation.
The next versions will focus on recommending a general metadata standard
based on those already used in the community, and requiring a small number
of metadata keys to enabled multimodal analysis.

Aiming for integration with existing standards, we plan to develop
automated methods for converting raw data files stored in a NeuroBlueprint
project to NWB. We will constantly strive for full alignment with the BIDS
standard and update when possible as BIDS expands into systems neuroscience.
