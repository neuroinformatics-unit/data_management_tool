# Roadmap

Here we lay out the roadmap for
[NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/)
and **datashuttle**. The roadmap is largely determined by needs
of the community and we strongly encourage people to get in
contact to outline their needs and priorities!

The aim of the first version of **NeuroBlueprint** (v0.2) and **datashuttle** (v0.4)
are to provide a lightweight, standardised framework such that raw data
and derivatives of different data types (e.g. behaviour, electrophysiology)
can be automatically found.

The next aim will be to support more advanced multimodal analysis, requiring
metadata (e.g. sync pulses). The next version will focus on recommending
a general metadata standard based on those already used in the community,
and specifying specific metadata keys for the aim of automating multimodal analysis.

Aiming for integration with existing standards, we plan to develop
automated methods for converting raw data files stored in a NeuroBlueprint
project to NWB. We will constantly strive for full alignment with the BIDS
standard and update when possible as BIDS expands into systems neuroscience.
