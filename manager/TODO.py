# typing, doc

# Transfer file check (checksum, size, date)
# Tree to walk through entire directory tree
# doc, refactor, type
# CLI, GUI
# test pysync fork
# going to need to print all instances where a file was not moved because already exists.
# test breaking the internet connection mid-up / download
# add info file for each ses with date time etc.
# - print is currently used to feedback information, improve
# - logging
# - handling the configs is a little circlar ATM as if fail, set_config_path loads them back into the class, might be easier to extract make_config_file() to separate loading class / function
# TODO: doc that key is canonical while .name is user name
# refactor manager out...
# ftp_active argument - understand
# _generate_and_write_ssh_key delay
# Assumptions: the remote host is unix system
